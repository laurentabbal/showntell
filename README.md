# showntell - `maps`

The branches in this repository create pre-configured containers that demonstrate a range of subject specific  notebooks.

This branch is built to support the creation of map related assets.

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychemedia/showntell/maps)

The notebooks show how to create rich notebooks containing interactive and/or dynamically generated, embedded content assets within a Jupyter notebook.

The containers can be launched via *mybinder.org*

Several notebooks are provided:

- `index_maps.ipynb`: demonstrating embdding or interactive mapos using `ipyleaflet`, `folium`, `folium` magic, `basemap`, `cartopy`
- `Projection_demo.ipynb`: demonstrating a simple interactive for exploring different projections;
- `Shapefiles.ipynb`: first attempts at demoing handling of shapefiles
- `Satellite_Maps.ipynb`: first attempts at demoing retrieval and display of satellite imagery
