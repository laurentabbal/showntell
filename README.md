*Notebooks to demonstrate the authoring of`electronics` related materials.

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychemedia/showntell/electronics)

The notebooks (will...) show how to create rich content containing interactive and/or dynamically generated, embedded media assets within a Jupyter notebook.

A live demo environment can be launched via beta.mybinder.org.

The notebooks (will...) demonstrate:

- how to use the Python `SchemDraw` package to draw electrical circuit diagrams;

There are several notebooks in the demo:

- *index_electronics.ipynb*: circuit schematic examples etc;
- *Graphviz.ipynb*: using Graphviz to draw Finite State Machine diagrams;
- *Blockdiag.ipynb*: block diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, network diagrams, rack diagrams, packet diagrams.
