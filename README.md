# showntell - `3d`

The branches in this repository create pre-configured containers that demonstrate a range of subject specific  notebooks, in this case the rendering of 3D objects.

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychemedia/showntell/3d)

The notebooks show how to create rich notebooks containing interactive and/or dynamically generated, embedded content assets within a Jupyter notebook.

The containers can be launched via beta.mybinder.org
