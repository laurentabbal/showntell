# showntell - `maths`

This Binder container is seeded with a range of pre-enabled Jupyter notebook extensions and pre-installed Python packages that support the creation of maths related texts.

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychemedia/showntell/maths)

Example notebooks include:

- `index_maths.ipynb`: demonstrating a range of Jupyter notebook extensions for presenting mathematics related materials, including embedded formula using MathJax, equation numbering, simple interactive graph plotting, dynamically generated `asymptote` diagrams, symbolic Python;
- `Tikz.ipynb`: demonstrating the creation of mathematical figures / scientific diagrams using the *LaTeX* `TikZ` package;
- `Asymptote.ipynb`: demonstrating the creation of mathematical figures / scientific diagrams using `asymptote`;
- `OpenLearn_Geometry.ipynb`: a reworking of some open educational materials from OpenLearn.

### Example Slideshow:

The `index_maths.ipynb` additionally has cells marked up for use in a slideshow. From the notebook *Cell* menu select *Run All* to execute all the cells and then enter the slideshow using the *Enter/Exit RISE Slideshow* toolbar button (it looks like a bar chart). Exit the presentation using the cross in the topleft of the slideshow display.

To see the slideshow markup, go to the notebook *View* menu and select *Cell Toolbar* and then *Slideshow*. Reset the notebook disable using *View > Cell Toolbar > None*.
