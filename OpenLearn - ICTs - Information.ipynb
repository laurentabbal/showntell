    "*Voltage* (or, more correctly, electromotive force, emf – but I shall follow common practice and just say voltage) is a measure of the force with which electricity is 'pushed'. Nothing happens, however, unless there is an electric circuit, which is a path from one terminal of a voltage source (the battery, in this case) to the other, along which the electricity can flow (Figure 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "An electric circuit\n",
    "Figure 12 An electric circuit\n",
    "If there is an electric circuit, the rate at which electricity flows is determined by the nature of the circuit and the value of the battery's voltage. To quantify the rate at which electricity flows we need to know how much the circuit allows or resists the flow of electricity, and this is determined by a measure known as *resistance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a circuit has a high resistance, little electricity flows for a given voltage. If it has a low resistance, a lot of electricity flows. Resistance is measured in units called ohms, and the rate of flow of electricity is measured in units called amps. The rate of electricity flow, which we call the electric current, in amps is calculated by dividing the battery voltage in volts by the circuit resistance in ohms.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Current in amps}=\\frac{\\text{voltage in volts}}{\\text{resistance in ohms}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitatively, you might be able to see that this is plausible. The bigger the voltage (the stronger the push), the more current will flow. The bigger the resistance, on the other hand, the smaller the current.\n",

The relationship between voltage, current and resistance represented by this triangle has a special name: it is known as Ohm's law.
